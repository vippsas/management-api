# Management API

**Please note:**
The Management API replaces the
[Partner API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/partner-api/):
All the functionality in the Partner API is available in the Management API now,
and more functionality will be added. See each endpoint and the
[API specification](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/management/)
for details.
