# Management API

## Important information

ðŸ’¥
**DRAFT!** The Management API is in development, but not yet available.
This documentation is a working document, and used in discussions with
merchants and partners to make sure we are prioritizing right,
and that we are implementing the right functionality.
The Management API will replace the
[Partner API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/partner-api/).
ðŸ’¥

We can describe the development of the Management API in phases:

1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product): The same, or very similar, functionality as
   in the existing Partner API. Some endpoint URIs, requests and responses
   may change, but changes will be small.
   We aim to have this available in August 2023.
   Integrators can start integrating, using the
   [API spec](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/api/management/)
   today, as there will only be small (if any) changes before the API is available.
2. Exploration: Use the MVP to find out how the Management API can be improved,
   using the suggestions and draft functionality documented here.
   **Important:** Pay attention to whether the functionality described here
   is something that exists and is implemented, or if it is a draft/idea that
   can only be used in discussions.   
3. Improvement: Extend and improve the API based on input from existing and
   potential users.
